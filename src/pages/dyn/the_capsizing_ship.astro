    We are all familiar with the notion of the center of mass of a rigid body. In class, we have described the 
    position of the center of mass to be the average position of all the constitutent mass elements 
    weighted by the the total mass of the body. We have also learnt how to find the center of mass of composite bodies 
    and derived simple expressions for basic shapes. This practice can sometimes seem abstract, but do you know that 
    center of mass calculations are integral in understanding the stability of dynamic structures?

        After an investigation by the NTSB, 
        it was found that the ship collapsed due to the use of erroneous ballast quantities in the stability 
        calculation program, which produced incorrect stability conditions of the ship. In other words, a 
        moment or torque was generated from the difference between 
        the locations of the center of mass and the center of buoyancy.
        This torque arm produced an angular acceleration &alpha; that was opposite to the angular displacement
        &theta;, which meant that the ship was in unstable equilibrium. Thus, the failure in accounting for the 
        changes in ballast quantities meant that the hull of the ship was unable to provide a counter torque to
        these forces, and the ship capsized. Observe how you can combine concepts from both
        Statics and Dynamics in this example!

    <p>
    Ship stability reflects the relationship between buoyancy (the force pushing on a ship allowing it to float) 
    and gravity (the force pushing the ship into the water). The force of gravity acts downward through the 
    ship's center of gravity (G), while the buoyant force acts upward through the ship's center of buoyancy (B). 
    When a vessel is floating at an even keel or upright, the force of gravity and buoyancy are vertically aligned. 
    The stability of a vessel is usually expressed as the magnitude of the heeling moment that is necessary to capsize the 
    ship at a certain angle, called the heeling angle.

            <p>

                The center of buoyancy (B) is the point where the total buoyant force on a 
                submerged or floating object acts. You can think of it as the center of gravity of 
                the volume of fluid displaced by the object. This term is crucial for understanding 
                stability and equilibrium in hydrodynamics. 
            </p>


        </CalloutCard>

    </CalloutContainer>

    <p>

    
    When a disturbing force such as wave action or wind pressure exerts an inclining moment on a ship, 
    the ship's underwater volume shifts in the direction of the heel, 
    which causes the center of buoyancy to shift in the same direction. Unless the ballast of the ship
    (cargo, weights, etc.) is allowed to change, the center of gravity remains the same and lines of 
    action of the forces of buoyancy and gravity separate. The hull of the ship allows the exertion 
    of a restoring moment to bring the ship to an even keel, known as the righting moment. The special
    moment arm in this case is known as the righting arm. 

    </p>

    <p>
    
    A ship's metacenter (M) is the virtual intersection of two successive lines of action of 
    the force of buoyancy when the ship heels through a very small angle. 
    The initial position of the metacenter is used as a reference in stability calculations. 
    The distance from a ship's center of gravity (G) to its metacenter is known as the GM, 
    which measures the vessel's ability to right itself when experiencing an overturning moment.

    A simple pendulum can be thought of as a mechanical analog of a hydrodynamic system such as a ship. 
    A simple pendulum experiences restoring torque at its unstable position that brings it back to its
    stable equilibrium position, similar to the function of a righting moment in the example above. 
    However, in the case of an inverted pendulum, there is no stable equilibrium position. 
    The two examples presented below for the simple and inverted pendulum correspond to the ship 
    having low and high centers of gravity respectively. 
    

    <DisplayEquation background = True title = "Characteristic equation of a pendulum." id = "eqn-pend"
    equation = "\\begin{aligned}   \\ddot \\theta  = - \\frac{g}{l} \ \\sin(\\theta)  \\end{aligned}">
      
    </DisplayEquation>
        
    For a simple pendulum, the rest position or the vertical position where 
    the angular displacement &theta;=0 is the position of marginally stable 
    equilibrium. The reason the equilibrium is marginally stable is because 
    an oscillatory system like a simple pendulum does not become unbounded but 
    also does not achieve a steady state after an excitation. 
    At &theta;=0, its potential energy is lowest while the kinetic
    energy is maximized. However, at the two extrema on either side of the rest 
    position, the angular displacement &theta; from the stable equilibrium position
    is maximum and the pendulum has the maximum potential energy. This configuration
    induces a restoring torque &tau; that produces an angular acceleration &alpha;, 
    which is opposite to the direction of the angular displacement. The implication is that
    these extrema are unstable for the simple pendulum.

    </Slideshow>

    For an inverted pendulum, the rest position with &phi;= 0 is unstable since its potential energy is maximized. 
    This is an unstable system since the output due to an excitation is unbounded unlike a simple pendulum. 
    When the pendulum is displaced for some value of &phi;, the torque induced is in the direction 
    of the angular displacement, i.e., &alpha; and &phi; have the same signs. 
    You could think of this as being the case when the ship capsizes eventually. However, the 
    pendulum does not have a metacenter or a center of buoyancy, which are only valid for floating
    objects.

    <p>
        In its investigation of the MV Golden Ray capsizing incident, the NTSB conducted a stability
        analysis of the vessel by using different parameters for the weights of the ballast, bunkers, 
        liquid, and cargo. This allowed them to compare the loading conditions at the time of accident
        and those found in the loading manual for the ship by generating curves for the righting arm and
        the heel angle of the ship. 

    </p>

    <p>
        As can be seen from the <a 
        href="#rarmc1"> graph</a>, the length of the righting arm increases with the angle of heel to a maximum point. 
        In theory, the righting arm decreases after this point, reaching zero at a very large angle of heel. 
        A reduction in the size of the righting 
        arm usually means a decrease in stability. The area under the righting arm curve represents the energy available to 
        the ship to right itself, and in general, the more area under the curve, the larger the capsizing moments the vessel can resist. 
        The angle where the righting arm crosses zero denotes where a vessel's stability changes from positive 
        righting moments to negative capsizing moments. Vessels are often termed “stable” when they have 
        enough positive stability to return to an upright position in the conditions encountered as loaded, 
        and “unstable” when they do not, and capsize. 
    </p>

    From the above graph, we can estimate the stability of the vessel by measuring the slope of the righting arm curves,
    which dictates whether the ship will be stable or unstable at small angles of heel. The slight
    differences between the experimental and the theoretical findings seen through these graphs should 
    make you appreciate that center of mass is not just an abstract topic but a highly intricate notion
    in practical scenarios! The correlation between center of mass and stability is highly critical to 
    study of dynamic systems that are subject to external loading coditions and entails 
    precise calculations and services of experts in risk analysis.

#Extra callout card for inverted pendulum 

        <CalloutCard>

            <p>
                In practice, there is a way to stabilize an inverted pendulum at the top 
                by oscillating it at a very high frequency that generates a regenerative oscillation
                about the same point, but with higher amplitude and lower frequency. This is outside the 
                scope of the presented content, but you can learn more about these topics is classes 
                like ME 340 and TAM 412!
