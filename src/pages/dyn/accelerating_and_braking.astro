        What happens when we step on the gas or brake in a car? The
        car pushes against the road to either accelerate (gas pedal)
        or decelerate (brake pedal). But how are the forces on the
        car and wheels distributed? What determines whether the
        wheels grip the road or lose traction and spin or slide?
    </p>

    <p>
        To study this problem we need a model. Let's start with the simplest model and then
        gradually consider more complex models.

    <p>
        The simplest model of a car is to treat the entire vehicle
        as a point mass. On a <button
        class="seq-toggle:ava-fp-c:fbd" onclick="ava_fp_c.stepSequence('fbd')">free body diagram</button>
        we have vertical force balance for a stationary car. When
        the car <button
        class="seq-step:ava-fp-c:motion:stationary" onclick="ava_fp_c.stepSequence('motion', 'stationary')">accelerates</button>,
        there is a horizontal forward force on the car, and a
        corresponding backwards horizontal force on the ground. As
        the car picks up speed, <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29">air
        resistance</a> produces a backwards force. On the diagram we
        have drawn some forces offset from the center of mass, so
        that the vectors don't overlap. Because we are assuming a
        point mass model, however, all vectors are really acting at
        the same point.
      </p>
      <p>
        While cruising at a constant speed, there is a balance
        between the horizontal driving force and the drag force due
        to air resistance. When the car <button
        class="seq-step:ava-fp-c:motion:cruising" onclick="ava_fp_c.stepSequence('motion', 'cruising')">brakes</button>,
        there is a backwards force that slows the car down to a
        stop.

<SubSection title="2D rigid body model" id = "2d_rigid_body_model">
        <p>
        Consider a car sitting stationary on the ground, as shown
        below. We will take the entire car plus wheels to be a
        single rigid body. Clearly this is inaccurate (the wheels
        can't turn), but it is <a href="roq.html#roq.su">still
        useful</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        We start with the car stationary, sitting on the
        road. Gravity acts downward through the center of mass,
        while there are upwards reaction forces on the wheels and
        corresponding equal and opposite forces downwards on the
        ground. Because the car is not accelerating, the total
        forces on the car are in balance, as we can see on the
        <button onclick="ava_fr_c.stepSequence('fbd');">free body
        diagram</button>.

        When the driver <button
        class="seq-step:ava-fr-c:motion:stationary" onclick="ava_fr_c.stepSequence('motion', 'stationary');">presses down on the gas
        pedal</button>, this results in the car pushing back on the
        road, giving a net forward force on the driving wheels (the
        back wheels for our car), and the car accelerates up to
        cruising speed. Here we are including <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29">air
        resistance</a> but neglecting <a

        resistance</a>, and while cruising at constant speed the
        driving force exactly balances the drag force from air
        resistance. When the driver <button
        class="seq-step:ava-fr-c:motion:cruising" onclick="ava_fr_c.stepSequence('motion', 'cruising');">presses down on the
        brake pedal</button>, the car pushes on the road to slow
        down, giving backward forces on both wheels and causing the
        car to decelerate to a stop.

        cycle a few times while showing the <button
        class="seq-toggle:ava-fr-c:fbd" onclick="ava_fr_c.stepSequence('fbd');">free body
        diagram</button>. Observe the horizontal and vertical forces
        of the road on the car wheels. Also view the forces both in
        <button class="option-toggle:ava-fr-c:components" onclick="ava_fr_c.toggleOption('components');">vector
        components</button> and as total force vectors.
        </p>
        <p>
        The vertical forces of the road on the car always need to
        balance the gravitational force, but we can see that the
        distribution between front and rear wheels changes as the
        car accelerates and decelerates. This is because the
        horizontal driving and braking forces are below the center
        of mass and produce a moment. The vehicle is not rotating,
        so this moment must be counteracted by the ground
        forces. The force directions mean that the rear wheels take
        more weight during acceleration, while the front wheels take
        more weight during braking.
        </p>

<SubSection title="Traction, acceleration, and braking" id = "traction_acceleration_and_braking">
        <p>
        The maximum force with which the car can push against the
        road is limited by the <a href="rff.html">friction
        coefficient</a> of the tire multiplied by the normal
        force. This applies both during acceleration and braking.
        </p>
        <p>
        To accelerate as hard as possible, we should thus use a <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_layout#Rear-wheel-drive_layouts">rear-wheel
        drive</a> layout. If we accelerate too hard, however, then
        the back wheels will slip and experience <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelspin">wheelspin</a>,
        because the <a href="rff.html">dynamic coefficient of
        friction</a> is lower than the static coefficient.  While
        high-performance applications generally want to maintain
        traction in all cases, the impressive effects of traction
        loss are sometimes deliberately produced. Spinning the rear
        wheels in a <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_(vehicle)">burnout</a>
        produces smoke as the tires vaporize due to the heat from
        friction. <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_racing">Drag
        racers</a> perform a burnout at the start of a race to clean
        the tires and heat them to an optimal temperature. To easily
        produce a burnout a <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_lock">line lock</a>
        can be installed to enable the brakes to be applied only to
        the front wheels (although this is often illegal on street
        cars). Alternatively, a burnout <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://youtu.be/rSwOTV-jbns">can be performed</a> by
        disengaging the clutch, running the engine at a high revs,
        and then rapidly engaging the clutch. The high <a
        href="rkm">angular momentum</a> of the engine then provides
        a <a href="rkm">rotational impulse</a> to the rear wheels,
        causing them to lose traction.
        </p>
        <p>
        Even if traction is maintained during acceleration, a second
        problem that may occur is that the torque from the rear
        wheels can be enough to lift the front wheels off the
        ground, so that the vehicle performs a <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelie">wheelie</a>. This
        occurs very easily for motorbikes and BMX bicycles, due to a
        high center of mass to wheelbase ratio, but <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pro_Street_Camaro_at_launch.JPG">can
        also occur for cars</a> with poor geometry and sufficient
        power.
        </p>
        <p>
        The problems of wheel slip and wheel lift-off occur in
        reverse while braking. Any car with well-maintained brakes
        has sufficient braking power to cause the wheels to lock,
        even in dry conditions with good traction. For this reason
        many cars now include <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-lock_braking_system">anti-lock
        braking systems (ABS)</a>, which detect wheel locking and
        rapidly pulse the brake force to prevent locking. Even
        better than this are <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_brakeforce_distribution">electronic
        brakeforce distribution (EBD)</a> systems, which apply the
        maximal brake force to each wheel while maintaining traction
        and control, better than any unassisted human driver could
        achieve. Due to the weight transfer to the front wheels
        during braking, the front brakes generally apply much
        greater force and thus wear out sooner than the rear brakes.

<SubSection title="2D multi-body model" id = "2d_multi_body_model">
        <p>
        To understand how forces and moments act on the wheels, we
        need to separate out the <a href="#ava-sr">single rigid-body
        model</a> into multiple rigid bodies. The simplest version
        of this has one rigid body for the body, and four rigid
        bodies for the wheels. We will assume that the two front
        wheels always act as a pair (same forces, same motion), and
        similarly for the two back wheels.
        </p>
        <p>
        Again we start with the car stationary, and on the <button
        class="seq-toggle:ava-fm-c:fbd" onclick="ava_fm_c.stepSequence('fbd');">free body diagram</button>
        we see the balance of vertical forces. Remember that the
        force shown on each wheel is really doubled, as there are
        two front and two rear wheels.
        </p>
        <p>
        If we now <button
        class="seq-step:ava-fm-c:motion:stationary" onclick="ava_fm_c.stepSequence('motion', 'stationary');">accelerate</button>,
        then we see a clockwise moment applied to the rear (driving)
        wheels. This causes the wheel to rotate, but friction forces
        means that it must <a href="rkl.html">roll without
        slipping</a>, so there must be a forward contact force
        causing it to accelerate forwards. Counteracting this is a
        backwards reaction force from the car on the wheel. On the
        car we see that there are equal and opposite forces and
        moments at the axles. Just as in the <a
        href="#ava-sr">single rigid body</a> case, we have a net
        horizontal force causing forward acceleration, and moment
        balance means that the weight of the car is transferred
        primarily to the rear wheels.

        applies backwards moments to both wheels, causing them to
        slow down. To maintain non-slip, there is a backwards force
        from the ground at the point of contact. Because the wheel
        is slowing down, the car pushes forward on the axle. The
        ground/axle forces are trying to rotate the wheel forward,
        which must be counteracted by the braking moment. The
        braking moment is thus counteracting both the rotational
        inertia of the wheel, as well as the force couple from the
        ground/axle forces. Of these, the force couple is much
        larger (stopping a wheel without the car attached would be
        comparatively easy for the brakes). During braking we see
        again the weight being transferred to the front wheels.

        While we can learn a lot about car performance from the
        simple <a href="#ava-sr">rigid body</a> and <a
        href="#ava-sm">multi-body</a> models, there is a great deal
        of physics neglected by these models, which can be important
        for engineering design.
        </p>
        <p>
        Both the car and the tires are deformable bodies. The
        deformation of the tire is responsible for the <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_patch">contact
        patch</a> which generates the friction forces that allow a
        car to accelerate and brake. The physics of the frictional
        contact between the tire and ground can be very complex, as
        can the geometry of the tire. Modern <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire">tires</a> have
        complex <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tread">tread</a> patterns
        with grooves and lugs that are designed to channel away
        water and snow, maintaining traction even in challenging
        conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
        As well as being individually deformable, the wheels are are
        not rigidly connected to the car body <a href="#ava-sr">as
        above</a>, but they are actually connected by a <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)">suspension
        system</a>, consisting of <a href="aml.html">linkages</a>,
        <a href="rff.html">springs</a>, and <a
        href="rff.html">shock absorbers</a>. These enable both a
        comfortable ride and safe handling of the vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
        The simple models above included a simple model of <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29">air
        resistance</a>, but they neglected <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance">rolling
        resistance</a>. This is the force primarily produced by the
        tire being compressed and re-expanded at the contact with
        the ground as it rolls, producing a backward force on the
        wheel. Using steel wheels on steel can result in trains
        having up to <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance#Rolling_resistance_coefficient_examples">ten
        times lower</a> coefficients of rolling resistance than car
        tires, which is one reason for the efficiency of rail
        transport.

                evidence</a> that the wrinkling of fingers in
                water may serve the same purpose as tread patters on
                tires, improving traction in wet conditions by forming
                channels to carry away water. This hypothesis is supported
                by the fact that <a

        The above model shows equal brake force applied on the front
        and rear wheels. This both inefficient and dangerous, as the
        rear wheels will lock while the front wheels are still
        turning. See #avs for steering and sliding. We want to apply
        more force on the front brakes, so that we can deliver the
        most total force while still having no sliding. This can be
        achieved by <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_brakeforce_distribution">electronic
        brakeforce distribution (EBD)</a> systems, however
        traditional systems are also possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The basic outline of a brake system is that the brake pedal
        pushes on a <em>master cylinder</em>, which compresses
        hydraulic <em>brake fluid</em> in the <em>brake
        lines</em>. This then pushes on <em>slave cylinders</em> in
        each wheel, which push the <em>brake pads</em> onto the
        <em>brake rotors</em> (for disc brakes; drum brakes are
        somewhat different). The combination of slave cylinders and
        brake pads and their housing is called a <em>brake
        caliper</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
        To apply more force to the front brakes, one simple system
        used in practice is to have the front-wheel slave cylinders
        have a larger diameter than those on the rear
        wheels. Because the pressure in the brake lines is the same
        everywhere, the force exerted by the pistons is proportional
        to their cross-sectional area, resulting in more force with
        the larger-diameter front-wheel cylinders.
        </p>
        <p>
        Modern cars use more advanced systems. The master cylinder
        typically contains two pistons in a parallel arrangement, so
        that it can apply pressure to the front or rear brake lines
        even if the other brake line develops a leak. A <em>metering
        valve</em> applies pressure to the rear brakes before the
        front, improving vehicle steering stability and allowing
        mixed drum/disc systems to be used. A <em>pressure
        differential valve</em> detects brake hydraulic leaks by
        sensing different front/rear line pressures. A
        <em>proportioning valve</em> assists with applying a
        different pressure distribution to the rear brakes.
