      We normally think of our classroom or laboratory as being
      stationary when we are doing dynamics. But how valid is this
      assumption?
    </p>
    <p>
      We will consider motion due to:

    <p>
      As we will see below, some of these velocities are not
      small. Why is normally valid to assume that we are in an
      inertial reference frame?

        The first people to have a rough idea of the radius of the
        Earth and the distance to the Sun were the ancient

  <p>
    We all know that one day is 24 hours long. But the period of
    the Earth's rotation is not 24 hours! This is because of the
    difference between <i>solar time</i> and <i>sidereal
    time</i>. Solar time is the time measured against the Sun,
    as we normally do. Sidereal time is measured against the
    stars, which is slightly different.
  </p>

      Schematic of the Earth's rotation about its own axis and
      about the sun, counting solar days and sidereal days. Here
      the Earth has just 8 solar days per year for better
      visualization.
    </p>
  </PrairieDrawCanvas>

  <p>
    As we can see above, the Earth rotates one more sidereal day
    each year than solar days. This means the following equation is true.
  </p>
  <p>
    <DisplayEquation equation="\\text{1 solar year} = \\text{365 solar days}= \\text{366 sidereal days}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    So, the following equation is also true.
  </p>
  <p>
    <DisplayEquation equation="\\begin{aligned}\\text{sidereal day} &amp;= \\frac{365}{366}\\ \\text{solar day} \\\\&amp;= \\frac{365}{366} \\times 24\\ {\\rm h} \\\\&amp;= 23.93{\\rm\\ h} \\\\&amp;= 23{\\rm\\ h}\\ 56{\\rm\\ min}\\end{aligned}" /> 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Earth's orbital angular velocity is thus actually
    <InlineEquation equation="\\omega = 360^\\circ / (23.93{\\rm\\ h}) = 15.04^\\circ/\\rm h" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    The relationship between solar and sidereal days can also be
    computed by considering just a single day, as shown
    below.
  </p>

      Diagram of one solar day and one sidereal day for the
      Earth, not drawn to scale. The fact that <InlineEquation equation="\\omega_{\\rm E}" />
      and <InlineEquation equation="\\omega_{\\rm S}" /> are in the same direction means that
      sidereal days are shorter than solar days (this is <a
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebular_hypothesis">not
      a coincidence</a>).

  <p>
    Just as for the definition of a day, there is a similar
    distinction between the <em>synodic lunar month</em>, which
    is the time between passes of the Moon between the Earth and
    the Sun, and the <em>sidereal lunar month</em>, which is the
    orbital period of the Moon in an inertial frame. In common
    usage, the phrase <em>lunar month</em> refers to the synodic
    month.

      <p>
        Just as sidereal days and solar days are different, the
        exact length of one year depends on how we define it. The
        <em>sidereal year</em> is the time for the Earth to
        complete one orbit relative to the fixed stars, and has
        length 365.256363 solar days. The <em>tropical year</em>
        is the time for the Earth to return to the same point in
        the seasons, which varies around a value of about
        365.242189 solar days (about 20 minutes shorter than the
        sidereal year). These years are different because of the
        <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession">axial
        precession</a> of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p class=mb-0>
        In common usage the word “year” refers to the tropical
        year, as the seasons have historically been more important
        for people than the motion of the stars. Observe the following equation.
      </p>
        <div style="font-size: 1rem;">
          <DisplayEquation equation="365.242 \\approx 365 + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{400}" />
        </div>
        
      <p>
        This is why leap years in our <a
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian
        calendar</a> add an extra day every 4 years, unless the
        year is a whole century, except every 400 years. If our
        calendar used sidereal years instead of tropical, the fact
        that 365.256363 is slightly larger than 365.25 would mean
        that about every 200 years we would need to have a double
        leap year, when there would be two extra days (February
        30?).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        While leap years occur because the year is not an exact
        integer number of days, a similar problem is caused by the
        fact that the solar day is not exactly 24 × 60 × 60
        seconds. The length of the day actually varies somewhat
        unpredictably due to tidal friction as well as climactic
        and geologic events such as glacier formation and mass
        redistribution in the mantle, both of which change the
        Earth's moment of inertia. To correct for these variations
        a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap
        second</a> is occasionally added, in which the last minute
        of the day has 61 seconds.
