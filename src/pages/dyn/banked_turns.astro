<p>
        Turning in a circle requires a vehicle to have a centripetal acceleration inwards
        on the turn, and so there must be some centripetal force
        that produces this acceleration. For a vehicle driving on
        flat ground, this force must be produced by a sideways
        friction force on the tires. This introduces two problems:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the coefficient of friction is not high enough (say the
          road is wet or icy), then the friction force will be
          insufficient and the vehicle will slide off the road.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even if the friction force is high enough, because it acts
          at the bottom of the tires, it produces a net moment about
          the center of mass, which can cause the vehicle to roll
          over.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To avoid both of these problems, the road can be <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banked_turn">banked</a>
        inwards, so that the outer edge of the road is higher than
        the inner edge. This is called <em>superelevation</em> and
        means that some of the centripetal force can be provided by
        the normal force with the road, reducing the friction force
        and minimizing the risk of slip or roll.
      </p>
      <p>
        The figure below shows a bus driving around a sharp corner
        at high speed on a heavily banked road. To understand the
        dynamics of this vehicle and the design tradeoffs for
        cornering on banked turns, we need a model. We will start
        below with a simple point mass model, which will be enough
        to understand friction and sliding, and then move on to a 2D
        rigid-body body to understand roll behavior.

        To understand the dynamics of the bus
        above, we first need a simple model of the geometry of
        the road. A satellite photo of the track is shown below. The
        bus was photographed while on the far-left-hand curve, which we
        can see is approximately a half-circle with radius about 50
        m.

        To make a simple model, let us consider a track with
        straight segments and half-circular ends, as shown below. If
        we <button class="anim-toggle:avb-fg-c" onclick="avb_fg_c.toggleAnim()">animate</button> the
        bus then we can see the <button
        class="option-toggle:avb-fg-c:vectors" onclick="avb_fg_c.toggleOption('vectors')">vectors</button> for
        velocity, acceleration, and force as the bus drives around
        the track. We assume constant speed, so there is only an
        acceleration when the velocity
        changes direction around the corners. This model assumes
        semi-circular track ends, but this is
        not a good idea in practice.

      <p>
        The centripetal acceleration must be caused by an inwards
        force while going around the corners. To understand the
        magnitude and source of this force, we now consider a simple
        point mass model.

<SubSection title="Point mass model" id = "point_mass_model">
    <p>
        Consider the bus as a single point mass on the track while
        going around the corner. The diagram below shows the bus
        front-on, so the inside of the track is towards the left. We
        start by assuming there is no bank on the road and that the
        bus is stationary. The <button
        class="seq-toggle:avb-fp-c:fbd">free body diagram</button>
        shows that the gravity force \(W\) is balanced by the normal
        force \(N\) from the road. If we now increase the bank
        angle \(\theta\) below, then we see that a friction force
        \(F\) tangential to the road is needed to keep the bus from
        sliding. In practice, this force will be limited by \(F \le
        \mu N\), where \(\mu\) is the coefficient of friction. If we
        incline the track until it is nearly vertical, we see that
        there a huge friction force would be required but only a
        tiny normal force is available. As this would not be
        possible without gluing the tires to the road, this
        situation would result in the bus sliding downwards towards
        the center of the track.

      <p>
        Now set the bank angle back to \(0^\circ\) and make sure the
        speed is zero and that the <button
        class="seq-toggle:avb-fp-c:fbd" onclick="avb_fp_c.stepSequence('fbd')">free body diagram</button>
        is visible. Now increase the speed of the bus to produce a
        centripetal acceleration. <a
        href="/sta/introduction#rkn-en">Newton's law</a> implies that there
        must be a centripetal friction force producing this
        acceleration. As the speed increases, we will eventually
        reach a point when the friction force required is too large
        and the bus will slide outwards on the track.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid sliding outwards, we can increase the bank on the
        road. This increases the normal force and decreases the
        friction force, making it less likely that sliding will
        occur. For any given speed, there is some angle that exactly
        cancels the friction force, so that all the force is normal
        force. This is a very safe driving situation, as no sliding
        is possible, even in very slippery road conditions. On the
        <a href="#avb-fc">real track</a>, the bank angle increases
        as the bus drives higher. This allows the driver to select
        the correct incline angle to minimize sliding risk. We can
        also show the forces in <button
        class="option-toggle:avb-fp-c:components" onclick="avb_fp_c.toggleOption('components')">components</button>
        or as total vectors as we change the bank angle and bus
        speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this simple point mass model allows us to understand
        how banking the road can help with the problem of sliding,
        it does not tell us anything about rolling of the vehicle,
        because point masses can't rotate. We thus need a rigid body
        model to investigate roll.

<SubSection title="2D rigid body model" id = "2d_rigid_body_model">
          <p>
            We now use a single rigid body model for the bus and we will
            do everything in 2D. Below we see a front-on diagram of the
            bus, with the inside of the track to the left. If we turn on
            the <button class="seq-toggle:avb-fr-c:fbd" onclick="avb_fr_c.stepSequence('fbd');">free body
            diagram</button>, then we see that the weight of the bus is
            supported by two forces, one on each wheel. If we increase
            \(\theta\) then the weight is supported more by the
            down-slope wheel, and we also see sideways friction forces
            appear to stop the bus from sliding. If the slope becomes
            too steep, then the normal force on the up-slope wheel
            reverses direction, indicating that it is holding the wheel
            down onto the road. Physically this cannot happen, so at
            this point the bus would tip over. We needed this rigid-body
            model to understand this tipping behavior, as we couldn't
            model this with the <a href="#avb-sp">point mass

            If we now set the bank angle \(\theta\) back to zero, we
            can start to increase the speed \(v\). Now we see that the
            wheel on the inside of the track takes less of the weight,
            and the friction forces now stop the bus from sliding
            outwards on the track. If the bus goes too fast then it will
            roll outwards on the track (assuming the friction
            coefficient is high enough that it didn't slide first).
          </p>
          <p>
            Having considered both a banked road with stationary bus,
            and a moving bus on a horizontal road, we can now combine
            them to see the advantage of having a banked road when the
            bus is cornering. Choose a bus velocity, and then change the
            bank angle \(\theta\), so that the friction force is reduced
            (helping to avoid sliding) and the normal forces on the
            wheels are more evenly balanced (helping to avoid
            rolling). For any given speed, we can choose a bank angle so
            that there is simultaneously no sideways friction force and
            also exactly balanced normal forces. This is the safest bank
            angle for this speed.

            A straight road generally has the center somewhat higher
            than the edges to allow water to run off. This is called <a
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_slope">cross
            slope</a> or camber. When it is desired to have a banked
            turn, then the outer edge of the road is raised to produce
            <em>superelevation</em>, with the outer edge rising above
            both the center and the inner edge. The bank angle is chosen
            based on the radius of curvature of the turn and the
            expected speed of cars going around the turn, while still
            allowing for the fact that cars might be moving slowly or
            even stopped. The angle should thus not be chosen to
            eliminate all friction forces when cars are traveling at
            maximum speed, as this would be dangerous if traffic had to
            stop on the road.

            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velodrome">Velodromes</a>
            are arenas with tracks designed for high-speed bicycle
            races, as shown below, with speeds up to 85 km/h. The bank
            angle on velodrome tracks is chosen to minimize sideways
            forces on the bicycles when they are traveling at near
            maximum speeds, so the angle chosen depends on the radius of
            curvature of the track corners. For example, the Blaine
            velodrome track pictured below is 250 m long and has a
            43&#xb0; bank angle on the corners and 15&#xb0; banking on
            the straightaways.

            High-speed trains such as the French <a

            speeds of over 300 km/h and have run at <a

            to 575 km/h</a>. To accommodate cornering at such speeds,
            track bends are constructed with a large radius of curvature
            (at least 7 km for new tracks) and a bank angle of up to
            about 7&#xb0; (180 mm maximum superelevation with <a
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gauge">Standard
            gauge</a> of 1435 mm). For railways, banking the track is

            An alternative approach for cornering with trains is to
            leave the track relatively flat and to <a
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilting_train">tilt the
            train</a> as it travels around a corner. This allows
            high-speed trains to operate on regular tracks, while
            maintaining safety and comfort for the passengers. For
            example, the <a
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Tilt_Train">Queensland
            Rail Tilt Train</a> operates at 180 km/h by tilting at up to
            5&#xb0; around corners. As we see from our <a
            href="#avb-sr">rigid body analysis</a> above, tilting the
            train will help with avoiding tipping over at high speeds,
            but will not help with reducing horizontal friction
            forces. Even with a tilting train, entering a curve at too
            high a speed will lead to <a

              ICE</a> require many sophisticated engineering techniques
              to enable travel at extreme speed. Very smooth rails are
              needed, so the track is formed by welding the segments
              together into one precisely-aligned continuous steel
              line. The steel rails conduct heat too well for
              conventional welding, so <a href="">thermite</a> welding
              is used to join the track segments.

              At high speeds the train drivers are unable to see railway
              signals on the side of the track. Electronic signaling
              systems are used to communicate to the drivers, either <a

              Friction-based brakes produce too much heat, as they would
              need to absorb the kinetic energy of several hundred
              tonnes of train moving at over 300 km/h. Instead, <a
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_braking">dynamic
              breaking</a> is used, in which the electric motors
              powering the trains are run in reverse as generators and
              the energy is shed as heat in resistor arrays. At
              extremely high speeds, the wheels themselves cannot
              provide sufficient traction to enable braking, so
              technologies like <a
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake">magnetic
              induction brakes</a> are being developed, which directly
              push against the rails without involving the wheels at
              all.
