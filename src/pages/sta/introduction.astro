<SubSection title="Newton's laws" id="newtons_laws">

Newton's equations relate the acceleration <InlineEquation equation='\\vec{a}' /> of a point mass with mass <InlineEquation equation='m' /> to the total applied force <InlineEquation equation='\\vec{F}' /> on the mass (sum of all applied forces). 


</SubSection>

<SubSubSection title="Newton's first law" id="newtons_mass_and_energy_balances">

A particle at rest stays that way unless acted on by unbalanced forces.

<SubSubSection title="Newton's third law" id="newtons_third_law">

The mutual forces of action and reaction between two particles are equal, opposite, and collinear.

	<p>A point mass moving in the plane with an applied force. You can try to made the mass move in a circle and then see what happens when the force is suddenly removed, which will demonstrate Newton's first law (no net force implies motion at constant speed in a constant direction). Also observe which force directions cause the speed to increase or decrease.</p>

<SubSubSection title="Particles" id="particles">
<!-- Could change this section to "Idealizations" and write about particle idealizations, rigid body assumptions, and concentrated / distributed force assumptions.  -->

In this course, we assume two things about particles: 

<ol>
	<li>The mass of the particle is not 0.</li>
	<li>The radius of the mass is 0.</li>
</ol>


 Through these assumptions, we are essentially concentrating all of the mass of an object at a single point in space. The particle has a mass but the size and shape of the particle is not taken into account. 

</SubSubSection>

<SubSubSection title="Rigid bodies" id="rigid_bodies">

For rigid bodies, we assume that the object has both mass (similar to particles) but also take its shape into account. 
</p>

<p>
We call these bodies "rigid" because we assume that they do not deform under applied forces or moments. 
</p>

<p>
A <em>rigid body</em> is an extended area of material that
          includes all the points inside it, and which moves so that
          the distances and angles between all its points remain
          constant. The location of a rigid body can be described by
          the position of one point \(P\) inside it, together with the
          rotation angle of the body (one angle in 2D, three angles in
          3D).

                <th>rigid body in 2D</th>
                <td>
                    <p class="m-0">position vector <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{r}_P" /></p>
                    <p class="m-0">angle <InlineEquation equation="\\theta" /></p>
                </td>

            <tr>
                <th>rigid body in 3D</th>

                    <p class="m-0">position vector <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{r}_P"/></p>
                    <p class="m-0">angles <InlineEquation equation="\\theta,\\phi,\\psi"/></p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </DisplayTable>

    <p>
        Neither point masses nor rigid bodies can physically exist,
        as no body can really be a single point with no extent, and
        no extended body can be exactly rigid. Despite this, these
        are very useful models for mechanics and statics.
