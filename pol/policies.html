					<!-- <h3><strong><a id="COVID19" name="COVID19">COVID-19 Expectations</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>Following University policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to 
					protect the health and safety of the community. 
					Students are also required to follow the campus COVID-19 protocols.</p>
					
					<p>Students who test positive for COVID-19 through a SHIELD Illinois community testing site 
					must not attend class. These students are judged to have excused absences for the 
					class period and should submit an excused absence request form found on the course webpage
					to receive accommodations.</p> -->
					
					<h3><strong><a id="Absences" name="Absences">Absences</a>:</strong></h3>

					<ol>
						<li>Excuses from assessments will only be given in the following circumstances:
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Illness.</li>
								<li>Personal crisis (e.g., car accident, required court appearance, death of a close
									relative).</li>
								<li>Required attendance at an official UIUC activity (e.g., varsity athletics, band
									concert).</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>In all cases you must complete the Excused Absence Request Form found on your course homepage and upload a scan of the official written documentation
							explaining your absence.</li>
						<li>In cases (a) or (b) an official excuse letter from the <a
								href="http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/student-assistance-center/">Dean on
								Duty</a> must be submitted via the online form within 2&nbsp;weeks of the due date of
							the missed assessment, but no later than reading day. In cases of extended or unusual
							illness, late submission of excuse documentation will be considered.</li>
						<li>In case (c) an official letter from the designated university official must be submitted via
							the online form at least one week prior to the due date of the missed assessment.</li>
						<li>Notwithstanding the above, at your professor&#39;s discretion you may be required to make up
							any excused work or attend substitute instruction or assessment.</li>
					</ol>


					<h3><strong><a id="Academic integrity" name="Academic integrity">Academic integrity, harassment, and
								discrimination</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>Academic integrity infractions, harassment, and discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.
						See the University&#39;s <a href="http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/">Student Code</a>,
						<a href="https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/">Article 1, Part
							4</a> and the <a href="http://oeoa.illinois.edu/campusconduct.html">Campus Conduct
							Policy</a>. Please report any concerns immediately to your professor.</p>

					<p>Academic integrity infractions <strong>will be dealt with using the most stringent available
							counter-measures.</strong> All infractions are documented through the campus-wide FAIR
						database, that remains part of the student&#39;s permanent record. All infractions in this
						database will be referred to the <a
							href="http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/student_discipline/"><strong>Senate
								Committee on Student Discipline</strong></a> for review and potential additional
						sanctions. Typical pentalties in TAM 2XX courses for academic infractions include dropping one
						course letter grade. Students have been expelled from the university for cheating.</p>

					<p>Infractions include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, and assisting others in a
						manner not prescribed or allowed for in the original assignment or directions. Notably, for
						homework assignments, students are encouraged and allowed to work together. The philosophy is
						that homeworks are <em>formative</em> assessments, meaning they are intended to foster learning.
						This is in contrast to <em>summative</em> assessments, including quizzes and exams, that measure
						individual student mastery of course concepts, for which students are of course forbidden from
						assisting each other.</p>

					<p>Computer-based testing deserves special mention. This testing is typically given across multiple
						days. <strong>During the entire time period of testing, students are strictly forbidden from
							discussing any aspect of the test/quiz whatsoever with other students.</strong> This
						includes specifics of questions, general aspects of questions, comments on the difficulty of the
						quiz, etc. This policy is strictly enforced to preserve the integrity of the computer-based
						testing.</p>

					<h3><a id="Contact" name="Contact"><strong>Contact and obtaining help:</strong></a></h3>

					<p>The two main ways to obtain help are online at Campuswire, or in person at office hours.
						You can also speak with your professor briefly after lecture. Please do not send email directly
						to CAs, TAs or professors for routine help or absences. &nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong><a id="Campuswire" name="Campuswire">Online forum (Campuswire)</a>:</strong></p>

					<p>This class uses <a href="https://campuswire.com/">Campuswire</a> for ALL
						communications between the instructor, TAs, CAs, and students. Students should not communicate
						with instructors via email. This is so we can ensure a faster response and keep everyone
						informed about what&#39;s going on.</p>

					<p>Students are encouraged to post public messages on Campuswire (&quot;Post to Entire Class&quot;). If
						you like, you can post anonymously, but we encourage everyone to use their name because it makes
						a friendlier and more welcoming environment. We will never judge anyone for asking anything on
						Campuswire, and you will see professors, TAs, and CAs making mistakes and saying stupid things as
						well!</p>

					<p>You can use the private feature on Campuswire by posting a message visible only to the Instructors.
						To do so, choose the &quot;Post to instructors and TAs&quot; option in the dropdown menu located at 
						the bottom right corner of the window.</p>


					<h3><strong><a id="Gradebook" name="Gradebook">Gradebook</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>All assessment scores are stored on Canvas. Note that we are only using this website for grade
						reporting. All other class-related information will be posted only to the official class website
						or Campuswire. Any errors in grade reporting appearing on Canvas must be reported to
						&quot;Instructors&quot; via Campuswire within 2 weeks of the due date of the assessment item or by
						the last day of class, whichever is earlier.</p>

					<h3><a id="Lectures" name="Lectures"><strong>Lectures:</strong></a></h3>

					<p>Prompt and regular attendance at lectures is essential for your comprehension and success in the
						course.</p>

					<h3><strong><a id="iClickers" name="iClickers">iClickers</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>Short quizzes are conducted during lectures using iClickers.
						You can use either a physical remote or the iClicker app. An iClicker remote can be purchased 
						from any of the bookstores. You must sign up for an iClicker.com account, and register for
						the class you are enrolled in by searching for it once you are logged in.</p>
					<p>iClicker participation grade is worth 5% of final course grade.						
						Your lowest six iClicker scores for the semester will be dropped automatically. These drops 
						should be reserved for unexpected occurrences such as sickness or a family emergency. 
						No missed iClicker scores will be excused for the semester regardless of the reasons.</p>

					
					<h3><strong><a id="Quiz" name="Quiz"></a></strong><strong>Computer-based quizzes:</strong></h3>

					<p>This course uses the College of Engineering Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF) for its
						quizzes and exams: <a href="https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/">
							https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu</a>.</p>

					<p>The policies of the CBTF are the policies of this course, and academic integrity infractions
						related to the CBTF are infractions in this course.</p>

					<p>If you have accommodations identified by the Division of Rehabilitation-Education Services (DRES)
						for exams, carefully go through and follow these instructions: 
						<a href="https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students/dres">https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students/dres</a>. 
						Please note, The CBTF cannot add DRES accommodations at the time of an exam. 
						They MUST be uploaded 5 business days beforehand.</p>

					<p>Any problem with testing in the CBTF <strong>must</strong> be reported to CBTF staff at the time
						the problem occurs. If you do not inform a proctor of a problem during the test then you
						<strong>forfeit</strong> all rights to redress.</p>

					<p>Review all instructions on the CBTF website before your first exam: 
						<a href="https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students">https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students</a></p>
					
					<!--
						
						Each quiz grade is determined from the following formula:</p>
						<p><strong>0.9*max(First Try, Quiz Retry) + 0.1*min(First Try, Quiz Retry).</strong></p>
					<p>If you have an excused absence for the quiz, then you will take the assessment at a later date,
						or make other arrangements at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
						
					<p><strong><a id="Quiz review policy" name="Quiz review policy" style="background-size: 16px;">Quiz
								review policy</a></strong></p>

					<p>Quiz review sessions are offered for some of the weekly quizzes. You must sign up for a review
						slot through the CBTF scheduler page.&nbsp;You will have the opportunity to sit at a CBTF
						computer and review your entire quiz from the previous week,&nbsp;as well as your scanned
						scratch paper from the quiz (if you turned it in after you finished your quiz). TAs will be
						available to help analyze your quiz with you if you wish.

					<p><u>Please note:</u> Quiz review gives you the opportunity to see your specific quiz instance,
						with the specific numbers for your question, and review it with the TA. If you visit TA or
						Professor office hours, we are always happy discuss&nbsp;a question you saw on the quiz as you
						remember it, and you may take all the notes you wish at this time, and keep them&nbsp;- but
						review of specific quiz instances can only be accommodated during the quiz review sesion.</p> -->


					<h3><strong><a id="Discussion" name="Discussion">Discussion sections</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>Discussion sections start in Week 1 of the semester. Prompt and regular
						attendance at your discussion section is required. You <strong>must</strong> attend only the
						discussion section in which you are enrolled. You will not receive a grade for the worksheet if
						you attend the wrong discussion section.</p>

					<p>Most discussion sessions will consist of a group worksheet exercise, which is a high-energy and
						efficient 50-minute learning experience. Students will be placed in permanent groups of three to
						four people during the third week of classes. <strong>If you are more than 5 minutes late to a
							discussion session then you will not receive credit for the section.</strong> All members of
						the group should be working together as a team. The TAs and CAs will be evaluating team work,
						problem-solution skills and interpretation of the problem.</p>

					<p>There are two main goals for the discussion worksheets:</p>

					<ol>
						<li><strong>Gain experience in team-work.</strong> This is a critical skill in all areas of
							engineering, from large-scale industrial projects to academic research. Working productively
							in teams is a skill that must be learned just like math or physics, and regular practice is
							essential. Often you will have to work with people who you do not especially like, or who
							you find it difficult to work with. It is important to lean how to manage these situations
							so that the important work is still accomplished.</li>
						<li><strong>Apply engineering concepts to real-world problems.</strong> Each worksheet focuses
							on a real-world problem that you will have to use your engineering skills to solve. This
							will include using the material from class, but also knowledge from previous engineering,
							math, and science classes. You will also have to think like an engineer, and understand when
							to make approximations, how to judge the appropriateness of different models, and which
							mathematics and physics is most useful for a given engineering problem.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>We also hope that these discussion worksheets will help you to meet other engineering students
						and we encourage you to get together outside of lectures and discussions to work collaboratively
						on homeworks and exam study.</p>


					<h3><strong><a id="Homework" name="Homework">Online homeworks</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>Weekly online homeworks will be assigned via <a
							href="https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu">PrairieLearn</a>. Each assignment is due at
						11:59pm on the assigned due date. Due dates are available inside PrairieLearn. These assignments
						place an emphasis on <strong>mastery</strong>. The idea is to keep doing questions until you
						master the underlying concept or method. Once you do, you should be able to answer these
						questions very quickly.</p>

					<p>The way this works in PrairieLearn is that each question has a value, a point total, and a point
						maximum. If you answer a question correctly, two things happen:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The point total increases by the value, until you reach the point maximum.</li>
						<li>The value increases (2x, 3x, 4x, etc.).</li>
						<li>The value increases (2x, 3x, 4x, etc.).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If you answer a question incorrectly, one thing happens:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The value goes back to what it was originally (1x).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This system rewards repeated correct answers, which tend to demonstrate mastery. There is no
						penalty (other than resetting the value) for answering a question incorrectly, so don&#39;t be
						afraid to submit an answer. Similarly, don&#39;t be afraid to keep doing a question after you
						reach the point maximum - your point total with never go down!</p>

					<p>If you click on the &quot;?&quot; just to the right of the line about available credit,
						you&#39;ll see all the dates associated with this homework. In particular, it says:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>you can receive 100% until Main End Date</li>
						<li>you can receive 80% until Extended End Date(two days later)</li>
						<li>you can receive 0%, but can keep doing problems as practice for the rest of the semester.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Note that your score will never go down. For example, if you achieve 90% by the Main End Date,
						you won&#39;t be able to increase your score after that time, but you won&#39;t be penalized for
						not reaching 100% - your score will remain 90% forever. On the other hand, if you achieve only
						70% by the Main End Date you will be able to increase your score after that time (to a maximum
						of 80%) until the Extended End Date.</p>



					<h3><strong><a id="Special accommodations" name="Special accommodations"> Special
								accommodations</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>To obtain disability-related academic adjustments or accommodations, students with disabilities
						must contact their professor and <a href="http://disability.illinois.edu/">Disability Resources
							and Educational Services (DRES)</a> as soon as possible. Students who require special
						accommodations for exams should schedule to take their exam at DRES, and DRES staff will
						communicate with the professor to organize the exam. There is no need to inform the professor
						about this in advance.</p>

					<p>If you have accommodations identified by the Division of Rehabilitation-Education Services (DRES) 
						for exams, please submit your Letter of Accommodations (LOA) 
						<a href="https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students/dres/">here</a> before you make your first 
						exam reservation. This must be done each semester you use the CBTF.</p>

					<p>The use of Campuswire should not replace the in-person Office Hours time, since some questions cannot
						be fully addressed via an online forum.</p>

					<h3><strong><a id="FinalExam" name="FinalExam">Final Exam</a>:</strong></h3>
